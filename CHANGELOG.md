## TaskSync v2.0.19 (02-18-26)
feat: extend response timeout to 4 hours and add 2-hour session warning
- Extended response timeout configuration with new options at 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes
- Added a one-time warning notification after 2 hours of continuous session activity
- Updated documentation to reflect the new 4-hour maximum timeout and session quality guidance


## TaskSync v2.0.18 (02-18-26)
- feat: add markdown link handling and styling in webview


## TaskSync v2.0.17 (02-18-26)
- **Response Timeout**: Auto-respond to pending tool calls if user doesn't respond within a configurable time window (5–120 min); sends Autopilot text when Autopilot is enabled, or a session termination message when disabled
- **Max Consecutive Auto-responses** (`tasksync.maxConsecutiveAutoResponses`): Limit the number of consecutive timeout auto-responses (default 5) before the session is automatically terminated, preventing infinite loops
- **Per-workspace Isolation**: Queue, history, and settings are now stored per-workspace using workspace-scoped storage with fallback to global; no more cross-project contamination
- **New Session replaces Clear Session**: "Clear Current Session" command replaced with "New Session" — properly cancels pending requests, resets the timeout timer, and clears the auto-response counter before starting fresh
- **Session Timer in Title Bar**: Elapsed session time now displayed in the view title bar; timer freezes on session termination with a visual indicator
- **Session Health Tip**: Welcome section now shows "It is advisable to start a new session after 4 hours or 50 tool calls to lessen the risks"; badge tooltip echoes this recommendation
- **Structured Session Termination**: Session termination now uses a boolean `sessionTerminated` flag (replacing string matching) for reliable state tracking in both provider and webview
- fix: `startNewSession()` now correctly cancels pending requests, timeout timer, and resets the auto-response counter
- fix: `onDidChangeConfiguration` now handles live updates to `responseTimeout` and `maxConsecutiveAutoResponses` settings
- fix: History persistence updated to use workspace-aware storage path (`_getStorageUri()`)
- fix: Removed noisy `console.log` statements from timeout timer
- fix: Webview properly receives and uses the `sessionTerminated` parameter
- Update settings UI: timeout dropdown and max auto-response controls added to Settings modal
- Update welcome section Autopilot info and tooltip for session management context
- update welcome autopilot info and tooltip for session management


## TaskSync v2.0.16 (02-13-26)
- fix: enhance markdown list conversion and inline code handling in webview


## TaskSync v2.0.15 (02-13-26)
- fix: improve markdown parsing for italic text in webview


## TaskSync v2.0.14 (02-07-26)
- refactor: rename Auto Answer to Autopilot, improve UI and settings
- - Rename all autoAnswer references to autopilot across codebase
-   (package.json, webviewProvider.ts, webview.js, CHANGELOG, READMEs)
- - Add backward-compatible settings migration from old keys
-   (tasksync.autoAnswer  tasksync.autopilot, tasksync.autoAnswerText  tasksync.autopilotText)
- - Move Autopilot toggle beside the send button in the action bar
- - Remove redundant autopilot-bar row to eliminate unnecessary spacing
- - Update welcome section info tip with clearer Autopilot description
- - Replace toggle switch in Settings modal with Edit button for Autopilot prompt

## TaskSync v2.0.13 
- **Autopilot Mode** (renamed from Auto Answer): Automatically respond to `ask_user` prompts with configurable text for hands-free agent operation
- Autopilot toggle below the send button for quick access
- Customizable Autopilot response text via settings (`tasksync.autopilot`, `tasksync.autopilotText`)
- Queue priority: queued prompts are ALWAYS sent before Autopilot triggers
- Show tool call name preview in chat (truncated to 40 chars)
- Fix queue state reporting to accurately reflect whether response came from queue
- Fix stale settings overwriting user input for Autopilot text
- Fix redundant settings load in settings modal

## TaskSync v2.0.12 (01-06-26)

## TaskSync v2.0.11 (12-24-25)
- Add context references (#terminal, #problems) for attaching terminal output and workspace diagnostics
- Integrate context items into file autocomplete dropdown
- Display attachments in tool call history cards

- Fix memory leaks: proper cancellation cleanup, stale terminal execution tracking
- Add input length validation (500KB max for questions, 100KB for queue prompts)
- Use async file I/O for MCP client registration (non-blocking activation)
- Extract context providers into dedicated modules (ContextManager, TerminalContext, ProblemsContext)
- Consolidate duplicate CSS rules for code blocks and markdown
- Remove unused CSS (.welcome-tips, duplicate inline-code styles)
- Clean up JavaScript: remove unused variables, improve accessibility (ARIA labels)
- Fix race conditions in queue handling and request superseding
- Prevent orphaned promises when multiple ask_user calls occur
- Fix temp image cleanup timing (now cleaned on session clear/dispose)
- Improve webview ready state handling to prevent message race conditions
